**Demo Playwright Automation Framework**

This repository contains a demo automation framework that can be adopted by companies to run their UI automation suites.
It showcases real-world patterns and architecture, but it is not yet fully enterprise-ready. Several improvements are still needed before it can be deployed in a large-scale production environment.

**Framework Overview**

This is a Hybrid Automation Framework built using Playwright with JavaScript.
It combines the strengths of multiple industry-proven automation techniques:

**Page Object Model (POM)**

Encapsulates UI elements and page-specific operations, improving maintainability and scalability.

**Keyword-Driven Approach**

Common actions are abstracted into reusable keyword-style methods, enabling clean and readable test steps.

**Data-Driven Approach**

Test data can be externalized, allowing the same test logic to execute with multiple data sets.

**Current Status**

While the framework is functional and follows good automation design principles, it is not 100% enterprise-ready yet.
Enhancements such as stronger configuration management, improved fixtures, reporting layers, CI/CD integration, and parallel-safe architecture are still needed to make it fully production-grade.

**Intended Use**

This project is ideal for:

Learning Playwright framework structuring

Demonstrating hybrid testing architecture

Serving as a starter template for building a real enterprise solution

Showcasing automation engineering practices during interviews or portfolio presentations
